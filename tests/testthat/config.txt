To run the unit tests, you have to supply some Azure ML Studio keys.

To to this, copy the snippet of JSON below to a file called "config.json"
and put this in the same folder as the unit tests. Then edit the file to
contain your own test key values.

-----------------------------

{
"id"                  : "Add your workspace id here",
"authorization_token" : "Add your authorization token here",
}

-----------------------------

Optionally, if you wish to also specify AzureML API and management
endpoints, you can include them as:

-----------------------------

{
"id"                  : "Add your workspace id here",
"authorization_token" : "Add your authorization token here",
"api_endpoint"        : "Add your api_endpoint here",
"management_endpoint" : "Add your management_endpoint here",
}
